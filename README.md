# Potential Talents

I will be ranking potential job candidates based on a query and return a list of candidates that best fit the query. Once ranked I will be re-ranking candidates based on ideal candidates from the first list. 
I use a RankNet neural network model that is able to learn to rank the candidates and update it's ranking based on ideal candidates.

## Word Embeddings Used
* TF-IDF
* Word2Vec
* BERT
* GloVe

Word2Vec provided the best fit for the queries used to search for candidates.

## Example of Data
Query Used: 'seeking human resources'
