# Potential Talents

In order to help a talent sourcing company more easily sort through potential candidates to provide to technology companies, I will be creating a learning to rank model for their candidate list. I will be ranking potential job candidates based on a query and return a list of candidates that best fit the query. Once ranked, I will be implementing a model that will be able to rerank the list based on ideal candidates that are manually picked based on how well they fit the job description. 

I use a RankNet neural network model that is able to learn to rank the candidates and update it's ranking based on ideal candidates.

## Word Embeddings Used
* TF-IDF
* Word2Vec
* BERT
* GloVe

Word2Vec provided the best fit for the queries used to search for candidates.

## Example of Data
Query Used: 'seeking human resources'
